# lists-of-things

Datomic is now using the free edition. It's on clojars so just lein deps.


To start the transactor run:

  ./bin/transactor config/samples/free-transactor-template.properties

Or checkout a copy from
http://downloads.datomic.com/0.8.3438/datomic-free-0.8.3438.zip into the same
directory as lists-of-things is checked out into.

## BUGS

- parentsWithout(thing) might not be working properly. Instead just trancating
  one parent more or less at random.
- When the first static page load occurs you see it with no content for a
  moment before we ajax in the real content. This flicker should be avoided.

- Remove html based interface
  - Search
  - Display parents of open node above listing
  - Add parent in priview
  - Remove parents in preview
  - Save new content to db
  - Edit name of thing
- Refactor JS

  - Opening current thing
    - History
    - List
    - Preview
    - Breadcrumbs
- Restore normal browser behavior
  x Add history
  - Have the api return urls in addition to ids
  - Add links with meaningful hrefs to everything with an onclick
  x Have bs-index served dynamically inline with history and urls
  - Use \# to represent which child should be selected
x Display correct information
  x Make parents appear in the preview pane when a thing is opened (not just
    previewed)
  x Show thing's content on load
  x Shall all parents in listing except the current
