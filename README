# lists-of-things

Datomic is now using the free edition. It's on clojars so just lein deps.


To start the transactor run:

  ./bin/transactor config/samples/free-transactor-template.properties

Or checkout a copy from
http://downloads.datomic.com/0.8.3438/datomic-free-0.8.3438.zip into the same
directory as lists-of-things is checked out into.
